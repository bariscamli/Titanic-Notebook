My submission to the famous Titanic competition on Kaggle.

It was my first notebook that I've ever worked on and I reached top 12% after 10 submission.

I suggest that the notebook should be opened in nbviewer (link on the top right after you open the notebook) because some of the plots cannot be seen due to github viewer.

For my other notebooks, You can visit https://www.kaggle.com/mcamli.

Thanks for any comment and suggestions
